project-description: "Know Systemic Racism/Know More Names is a collaboration between Know Systemic Racism led by Felicia Smith, Racial Justice and social equity librarian at Stanford, and the CESTA lab Humanities + Design. The goal of the project is to design tools grounded in library practices to critically assess and undermine the racism that has been built into our social, political, technological systems. The work is guided by three core principles of Know Systemic Racism: Show interconnections; humanize the harm; communicate with the public. In Spring 2024, CESTA intern Shuvi Jha contributed to a project developed in collaboration with the American Friends Service Committee to bring personal experience to the categorization and description that defines military equipment used by California law enforcement."

# Reframing Police Militarization in California
:::{.article-author}

:::
This quarter, my research within the Know Systemic Racism project aimed to reframe the naming of military equipment by law enforcement. The trend of police militarization in the United States is rooted in historical developments such as the War on Drugs, which framed drug enforcement as a military conflict, the 1033 Program facilitating the transfer of military equipment to local police, and post-9/11 security measures that further militarized the police (GREENHUT, 2020; Friends Committee on National Legislation, n.d.; Mosley & McMahon, 2021). Media coverage of the 2020 protests following George Floyd's murder increased awareness of the police's use of military-grade equipment, including armored vehicles, tear gas, and tactical gear.

In 2021, California implemented CA AB481, requiring law enforcement agencies to disclose the militarized equipment they use and secure approval for its deployment. The law identifies 15 categories of equipment, from unmanned vehicles to other items requiring oversight (Bill Text - AB-481 Law Enforcement and State Agencies: Military Equipment: Funding, Acquisition, and Use., 2021). 

In my study, I examined the inventories of various Californian law enforcement agencies, including those in Modesto, Redlands, and Chula Vista. I noted the prevalence of equipment such as flashbangs, drones, and rubber bullets. I then aligned these items with CS AB481’s categories and compared the descriptions provided by manufacturers and law enforcement agencies. For instance, the descriptions for the “DJI 200 V2 with Zenmuse XT2 Thermal Camera” drone typically highlight technical efficiencies, like its thermal imaging capabilities and support for various police tasks, yet fail to address the embodied experience of its use.

To bridge this gap, my project lead Nicole and I developed alternative names for military equipment, calling them a separate category labeled “Civilian Description.” Drawing from research looking at firsthand accounts and experiences of the deployment of military equipment, this category aims to reflect the actual experiences of community members affected by police militarization. For example, a North Carolina resident recounted frequent drone surveillance at various civic events, underscoring the invasive nature of such monitoring. These accounts prompted us to label the drone as an ‘Omnipresent Surveillance Tool.’

# Next Steps

By contrasting official, manufacturer, and civilian descriptions, I confronted established power structures and brought to light the tangible impacts on communities, especially those within BIPOC areas. I documented the emotional labor and trauma faced by civilians, adhering to the principles of Data Feminism which advocates for rethinking hierarchies (D’Ignazio & F. Klein, 2020). The next step of the project is to incorporate these civilian experiences and descriptions into Wikidata to democratize the narrative and kickstart a community-wide initiative to challenge the often clinical and detached technical descriptions.
